For a unixporn workstation, the right wallpaper is key to completing your aesthetic. Here are some pointers and excellent resources to find beautiful, high-resolution wallpapers:

1. Dedicated Wallpaper Sites:

Wallhaven.cc: This is a goldmine for high-quality wallpapers. It has excellent search and filtering options (resolution, aspect ratio, tags, colors). You can specifically search for "unixporn" or related tags like "minimal," "abstract," "tech," "cyberpunk," "nature," or "geometric."

Unsplash.com: Offers a vast collection of high-resolution, royalty-free photographs. While not specifically for "unixporn," you can find stunning minimalist landscapes, abstract art, cityscapes, or macro shots that can look fantastic with a clean setup.

Pexels.com: Similar to Unsplash, Pexels provides free stock photos and videos. Great for finding high-quality images that can be adapted for a unixporn look.

Pixabay.com: Another excellent resource for royalty-free images, vectors, and videos.

SubtlePatterns.com: If you're looking for subtle, repeating patterns that can complement a minimalist setup, this site is a fantastic resource.

2. Reddit Communities:

/r/unixporn: This is the ultimate destination for inspiration. Browse through countless setups, and many users link to their wallpapers in the comments or in their dotfiles (configuration files). It's a great way to see how wallpapers integrate with different color schemes and layouts.

/r/wallpapers & /r/wallpaper: These subreddits are general wallpaper communities and often feature high-resolution images across various themes.

/r/WidescreenWallpaper: If you have an ultrawide monitor, this subreddit is tailored for you.

/r/amoledbackgrounds: For dark/OLED-friendly wallpapers.

/r/MinimalWallpaper: Focuses on minimalist designs.

3. GitHub Repositories:

Many "ricers" (those who extensively customize their Unix systems) share their wallpaper collections on GitHub. A quick search on GitHub for "unixporn wallpapers," "dotfiles wallpapers," or similar terms can lead you to curated collections.

D3Ext/aesthetic-wallpapers: A known collection of aesthetic wallpapers from various sources.

Look for dotfile repositories from popular unixporn setups â€“ they often include their wallpaper folders.

4. Art and Design Platforms:

DeviantArt: While it has a broad range, you can find a lot of user-created digital art that can serve as excellent wallpapers. Search for "unixporn art," "minimal desktop," or specific artists.

ArtStation & Pixiv: These platforms showcase professional and amateur digital art. You can find unique and visually striking pieces that might work well.

5. Consider Your "Rice" Theme:

The best wallpaper for your unixporn workstation will largely depend on the theme you're going for. Do you prefer:

Minimalist: Simple, clean lines, abstract shapes, gradients, or subtle textures.

Dark/AMOLED: Wallpapers with deep blacks and limited bright colors to save power and reduce eye strain.

Vibrant/Neon: Bold colors, sci-fi, or cyberpunk aesthetics.

Nature: Landscapes, macro photography, or celestial themes.

Abstract: Unique patterns, fractals, or artistic compositions.

Architectural/Urban: Cityscapes, unique buildings, or urban art.

Anime/Gaming: If you have specific fandoms, many high-res fan arts are available.

Tips for Choosing and Using Wallpapers:

High Resolution: Always aim for wallpapers that match or exceed your monitor's resolution to avoid pixelation.

Color Scheme Compatibility: Choose wallpapers whose dominant colors complement your chosen terminal theme, widget colors, and overall desktop environment. Many unixporn setups use tools to extract a color palette from the wallpaper to theme the rest of the system.

Clutter vs. Cleanliness: Consider how much "visual noise" the wallpaper introduces. A busy wallpaper might make your windows and text harder to read. Minimalist wallpapers often work best for a clean, functional unixporn setup.

Dynamic Wallpapers: Some desktop environments or third-party tools allow for dynamic wallpapers that change based on time of day, weather, or a set interval. This can add an extra layer of polish.

Personal Preference: Ultimately, the "most beautiful" wallpaper is subjective. Pick something that resonates with you and makes you happy to look at your desktop.

Happy ricing!
